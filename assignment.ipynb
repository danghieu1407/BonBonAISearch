      "Node.js is a powerful, open-source, and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 engine. It allows you to run JavaScript code outside the browser, making it ideal for building scalable server-side and networking applications. Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript on the server side. Traditionally, JavaScript was confined to web browsers, but Node.js extends its capabilities by allowing it to run on servers. Learn what Node.js is, how it works, and why it is used for web development. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that runs web applications outside the browser, using an asynchronous, event-driven model. Node.js is a JavaScript Runtime Environment that allows developers to create server-side applications. Previously, JavaScript was used only for client-side scripting in browsers. With the evolution of Node.js, JavaScript is also used for writing backend logic. Launched in 2009, Node.js focused on bringing JavaScript to server-side applications. There are several features that Node is well-known for, and it is primarily used to build fast and scalable network applications. With this, developers were unshackled and had much more freedom in operation.\n",
